<!-- 
    Michael Davis Site
    Purpose:
    This site was created by and for a Full Stack Designer with a deep understanding
    of Accessibility. The site has to function with as much semantic meaning as possible,
    since this is a direct reflection of the designer.

    Execution:
    The site is a one page design, with semantic tags used as often as possible.

    TODO:
    We'll most likely redesign the images on the front end, with color changes and tweaks
    where possible. News to come.

            <h1>Rift Valley Fever Poster</h1>
            <p>
                Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is an acute, fever-causing viral disease most commonly observed in domesticated
                animals with the ability to infect and cause illness in humans. RVF is generally found in regions of
                eastern and southern Africa where sheep and cattle are raised, but the virus exists in most of
                sub-Saharan Africa, including west Africa and Madagascar. There have also been outbreak reports in Saudi
                Arabia and subsequently, Yemen.
            </p>
            <p>
                These posters were designed to help prevent RVF and provide guidance if animals and/or people contract
                RVF.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to make the document was accessible I covered all of the elements of accessibility in design.
                Since color contrast is important for readability we made the two primary colors darker. Then I went
                through the document in InDesign and properly tagged the document.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the first poster was accessible, I did the same process for the next two English posters and then
                the French versions.

            <p>
                The Graphics Branch of the CDC can output, on average, around 6500 graphic projects in a year. A large
                percentage of
                those are Fact Sheets which are 1-2 page documents covering a specific topic. In order to keep up with
                the demand,
                templates were created to speed up the design process as well as standardize the CDC branding.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project updated the design of the templates as well as made them accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
                To the right (top) is an example of one of the older Fact Sheet templates. There are several brances of
                the CDC and each
                one has their own color branding. This orange is the primary color for the National Center for Emerging
                and Zoonotic
                Infectious Diseases (NCEZID). For the redesign of the Fact Sheets, the end goal was something that would
                combine the
                indivuality of the CDC branches with the visual brand of the CDC.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the final result the title bar had the primary branch color in different shades that all had enough
                color contrast
                to be accessible. The rays in the title bar were mimicing the rays in the CDC logo to further visualize
                the CDC branding
                of the product. The footer bar also contained all of the CDC branch’s colors. In addition, the InDesign
                document was
                given all of the necessary settings to make designing an accessible document a breeze.

                Medical Information Technology, or MEDITECH, is a medical electronic health record (EHR) company focused
                on making the
                jobs of doctors and nurses easier by digitizing medical processes and records for ease of use. During my
                time working
                this company, I worked on thier Home Care software which is a task-based system focused on patients
                needing home health
                and hospice care. Easily the largest design I lead while there was an enhancement to the Manage OASIS
                Assessments (MOA) task.
            </p>
            <p>
                OASIS is an acronym that means Outcome and Assessment Information Set. This is a patient- specific,
                standardized
                assessment used in Medicare home health care to plan care, determine reimbursement, and measure quality
                of treatment.
                The MOA task in Home Care was designed to manage all of the patient assessments conducted by teams of
                field nurses. The
                enhancement saw a variety of updates that made the task and others involving its use more user friendly
                as well as
                provide additional functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                A communication system was established so the reviewers and field nurses could discuss the assessments.
                The ability to
                print the conversation was added as well as a report to view the discussion. A status system was created
                to properly
                inform where the assessment was in the review process. Fixing assessment issues was streamlined. And
                other related tasks
                were updated to include the new status information.

            <b>Zika Emergency Response Accessibility</b>
            <p>
                Zika is a virus that is primarily spread through infected mosquito bites, but can also be transmitted sexually. This
                virus can also be spread from pregnant women to their babies which can cause birth defects.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was hired at the CDC during their emergency response to this virus. Many graphics were created as quickly as possible
                to spread vital information to the public, but these graphics weren’t created to be accessible. While the accessible
                information could be found online, it was still necessary to remake the graphic PDFs in an accessible format. I had a
                key role in making sure that these graphics were accessible and complied with both Section 508 and the Department on
                Health and Human Services regulations.

                <p>
                    The Home Care software is an incredibly complex and expansive application. While working on another project, I came
                    across an area of the software that was in desperate need of an update. I took it upon myself to research the
                    funtionality of the task, redesign it based on the research I acquired, and present the update to the Directors of the
                    Home Care team. The redesign was approved, added into the software, and I was commended for taking intiative and helping
                    to further improve the software.

                <p>
                    I’m a very goal-oriented designer. To me, the ultimate goal is to make someone’s life better through
                    design. I have to give credit to my mother for instilling a passion to help others in me at an early
                    age. Through this passion I have managed to aid practitioners in medical fields as well as help
                    people
                    who have disabilities through both design and volunteering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m always looking for new ways to better myself and I always aim to make my designs so that they
                    can be
                    enjoyed by all. The fields of UX and UI work incredibly well together, but I hope to use my
                    knowledge of
                    accessibility to take the designs in these areas to new levels.
