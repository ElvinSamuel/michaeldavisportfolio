<!-- 
    Michael Davis Site
    Purpose:
    This site was created by and for a Full Stack Designer with a deep understanding
    of Accessibility. The site has to function with as much semantic meaning as possible,
    since this is a direct reflection of the designer.

    Execution:
    The site is a one page design, with semantic tags used as often as possible.

    TODO:
    We'll most likely redesign the images on the front end, with color changes and tweaks
    where possible. News to come.

                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>
                            I’m a very goal-oriented designer. To me, the ultimate goal is to make someone’s life better through
                            design. I have to give credit to my mother for instilling a passion to help others in me at an early
                            age. Through this passion I have managed to aid practitioners in medical fields as well as help people
                            who have disabilities through both design and volunteering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’m always looking for new ways to better myself and I always aim to make my designs so that they can be
                            enjoyed by all. The fields of UX and UI work incredibly well together, but I hope to use my knowledge of
                            accessibility to take the designs in these areas to new levels.
                        </p>
