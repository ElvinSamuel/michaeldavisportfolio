<!-- 
    Michael Davis Site
    Purpose:
    This site was created by and for a Full Stack Designer with a deep understanding
    of Accessibility. The site has to function with as much semantic meaning as possible,
    since this is a direct reflection of the designer.

    Execution:
    The site is a one page design, with semantic tags used as often as possible.

    TODO:
    We'll most likely redesign the images on the front end, with color changes and tweaks
    where possible. News to come.
